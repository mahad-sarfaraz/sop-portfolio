   <h2>Early Aerospace Endeavor</h2>
    <p>At thirteen years old, after being impressed by the visionary aerodynamics of the Horten Ho 229 flying wing, I embarked on one of my first serious aerospace project. With foam core construction and traditional electronic parts, this early radio-controlled aircraft effort provided critical lessons in systems integration and aerodynamics when the prototype had numerous stability and thrust shortcomings.</p>

    <h3>Technical Challenges and Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Propulsion Limitations:</strong> The propulsion system had to be improvised due to the absence of EDF (Electronic Ducted Fan), due to which I had to design my own EDF. This improvised EDF had various issues, the thrust limitations was one of the most significant aspect.</li>
        <li><strong>Aerodynamic Instability:</strong> The aircraft had a lot of structural and aerodynamic instabilities. Primarily, the aircraft was not aerodynamic due to its bulkiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Systems Integration:</strong> Early lessons in weight distribution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Applied Knowledge</h3>
    <p>These formative experiences directly influenced my later work in designing UAVs and other experimental RC works. The R.A.3.D. stealth UAV program utilized lessons related to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Weight distribution optimization</li>
        <li>Power system dependability</li>
        <li>Aerodynamic polishing by iterative testing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Professional Reflection</h3>
    <p>This development from rudimentary prototypes to complex systems illustrates my love of aerospace engineering : every iteration, both successful and unsuccessful, generates information to drive the next development cycle. The practice of systematic testing and adjustment continues refine my approach to aerospace engineering.</p>
