    <h2>Lightweight Aerodynamic Design</h2>
    <p>Built with balsa wood and tissue paper for optimal strength-to-weight ratio.</p>
    
    <h3>Project discription</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A1H was designed and prepared for the Department of Mechanical Engineering Annual Day. Balsa wood was used as the material to make the airframe due to its lightness, with tissue paper being used to make the skin in order to have a smooth surface as well as provide structural strength without adding weight.

A 2200kv brushless motor, combined with a 30-amp ESC and 1000mAh 2C battery, provided outstanding thrust-to-weight ratios, making high-speed capability possible. The control surfaces—vertical and horizontal stabilizers, ailerons, and rudder—were operated by a 9-gram servo, providing extremely sensitive and responsive flight.
