    <h3>Project discription
</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>S.A.E. SUPRA is a national competition in which student teams develop, build, and compete using a Formula-type car, exercising their engineering and teamwork abilities. The activity centers on innovation, performance, and practical automotive concerns.

Support was provided in the carâ€™s production, including assembly, machining (e.g., welding, grinding), and structural design. Coordination within team as well as workflows were done in order to facilitate the continuity of the project on schedule as well as maintaining deadlines. MJCET (Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology) had taken part at this prestigious event during the year of 2024.
