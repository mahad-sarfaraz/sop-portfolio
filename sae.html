    <h3>Project discription
</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>SAE SUPRA is a national competition in which student teams develop, build, and compete using a Formula-type car, exercising their engineering and teamwork abilities. The activity centers on innovation, performance, and practical automotive concerns.

Such support was provided through producing and making the car, supporting in assembly, materials processing, as well as structural design. Coordination within teams as well as workflows were coordinated to facilitate the continuity of the project on schedule as well as maintaining deadlines.
