    <h2>Blended Wing Body Design</h2>
    <p>Dynamic morphing elevons inspired by bird wings for enhanced aerodynamics and fuel efficiency.</p>
    
    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project is based on a flying wing concept with a blended wing body (BWB) structure and adaptive camber elevons. Following the Boeing–NASA X-48B inspiration, the concept seeks to enhance aerodynamics, minimize drag, and enhance fuel efficiency. The strategy incorporates dynamic morphing elevons—mimicking bird wing adaptations—to maximize lift, pitch, and roll control.

The design procedure started with 2D drawings in AutoCAD, followed by 3D modeling in OpenVSP and XFLR5. Aerodynamic performance was critically evaluated using simulations in OpenVSP for main parameters like lift, drag, and lift-to-drag ratio. Application of adaptive camber on elevons, utilizing NACA airfoils, improves control and performance by changing wing camber dynamically in flight.

Results show a competitive lift-to-drag ratio and low drag, favoring the viability of this novel design for both commercial and military uses.</li>
