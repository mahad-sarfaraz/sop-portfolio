    <h2>Blended Wing Body Design</h2>
    <p>Dynamic morphing elevons inspired by bird wings for enhanced aerodynamics and fuel efficiency.</p>
    
    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project is founded on a flying wing design with blended wing body (BWB) shape and adaptive camber elevons. With the Boeing–NASA X-48B inspiration, the idea aims at improving aerodynamics, reducing drag, and improving fuel efficiency. The approach involves dynamic morphing elevons—replicating bird wing adaptations—to achieve maximum lift, pitch, and roll control. The design process began in 2D AutoCAD drawings before progressing to 3D modeling in OpenVSP and XFLR5. Aerodynamic efficiency was carefully assessed by means of simulations in OpenVSP for key parameters like lift, drag, and lift-to-drag ratio. Adaptive camber on elevons, using NACA airfoils, enhances control and performance as it dynamically alters wing camber during flight. The result is a competitive lift-to-drag ratio and minimum drag, supporting the viability of this new design for commercial and military applications.</li>
