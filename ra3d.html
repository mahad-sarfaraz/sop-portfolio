    <h2>Stealth UAV</h2>
    <p>Designed for precision payload delivery with Camera, tracking and launcher deployment.</p>
    
    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project entails the design and development of a stealth unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with different innovative systems to attain improved operational performance. The UAV is provided with electrical and green flight modes through the integration of solar power, accurate payload release, onboard WiFi camera monitoring, and Bluetooth tracking system. Moreover, the UAV is also designed to be ejected from a custom-made launcher for easy and controlled release into diverse mission environments. The UAV utilizes materials and aerodynamic shaping to reduce radar signatures, making it potentially invisible. The UAV also features solar panels built into its fuselage, although can provide power to led lights and acts as secondary power supplier . The UAV has a drop mechanism with controlled release of the payload. The drone has a WiFi camera for real-time video streaming. This feature allows for remote observation of points of interest in real-time. A Bluetooth tracking system enables accurate location tracking of the UAV and payloads.</li>
