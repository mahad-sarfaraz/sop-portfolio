    <h2>Solar-Powered Stealth UAV</h2>
    <p>Designed for precision payload delivery with WiF camera, Bluetooth tracking and launcher deployment.</p>
    
    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project entails the design and development of a cutting-edge stealth unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with different innovative systems to attain improved operational performance. The UAV is provided with electrical and green flight modes through the integration of solar power, accurate payload release, onboard WiFi camera monitoring, and Bluetooth tracking system. Moreover, the UAV is also designed to be ejected from a custom-made launcher for easy and controlled release into diverse mission environments.

Key Features and Elements
1. Stealth Design
Low Observable Technology: The UAV utilizes materials and aerodynamic shaping to reduce radar signatures, making it invisible.

2. Solar Power Integration
Solar Panel: The UAV also features high-efficiency solar panels built into its surface to be utilized for energy capture while in flight. Not only does this extend mission times by minimizing reliance on conventional battery sources but also offers a green approach to operation.

3. Dropping Mechanism
Precision Payload Delivery: The UAV has an drop mechanism with controlled release of the payload.

4. WiFi Camera System
Real-Time Monitoring: The drone has a WiFi camera for real-time video streaming. This feature allows for remote observation of points of interest in real-time.

5. Bluetooth Tracking System
Effective Localization: A native Bluetooth tracking system enables accurate location tracking of the UAV and payloads. The system is critical for mission recovery, with the ability to find the UAV and dropped devices within a limited timeframe.
